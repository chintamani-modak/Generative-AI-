It combines the strengths of \"closed-book\" (parametric only) approaches and \"open-book\" retrieval-based approaches. RAG is able to generate answers even when the correct answer is not in any retrieved document, making it an effective model for marginalization over documents. \n",

            "RAG is used for both extractive and abstractive question answering tasks, and has achieved state-of-the-art results on various open-domain QA datasets such as Natural Questions, TriviaQA, WebQuestions, and CuratedTrec. It has also shown impressive performance on abstractive tasks such as MS-MARCO NLG and Jeopardy question generation. \n",

RAG is able to retrieve relevant information from a large set of documents and use it to generate answers, making it a useful tool for tasks that require a deep understanding of a broad range of topics. Another use case of RAG is in fact verification, where it has shown promising results in comparison to other models. \n",
